# RAG quick start
By using [RAG_Quick_Start.ipynb], you can embed any passages for retrieval. All you need to do is to preprocess your passages to a specific format. There's an example of how to use the code. I embed one Sherlock Holmes novel (which is the [SH.txt])

I'm pretty sure [RAG_Quick_Start.ipynb] is NOT perfect!! I'll test it on different datasets and keep refining this!

# Study notes
I spent a lot time learning RAG, and added detailed notes in [train_rag.ipynb]. But it's a little bit messy...

# Exa datasets
I tried to use Exa to obtain RAG documents for OpenHermes-2.5 dataset. The code is in [Exa_dataset.ipynb].The result is in [search_response.json]. I gave Exa 100 questions and reached the usage limits. But there were only 10 responses. I haven't figured out why yet.
