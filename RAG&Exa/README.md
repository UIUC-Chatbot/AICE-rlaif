# RAG quick start
By using [RAG_Quick_Start.ipynb], you can embed any passages for retrieval. All you need to do is to preprocess your passages to a specific format. There's an example of how to use the code. I embed one Sherlock Holmes novel (which is the [SH.txt])

I'm pretty sure [RAG_Quick_Start.ipynb] is NOT perfect!! I'll test it on different datasets and keep refining this!

[3/17 update]\
I uploaded a new version quick start. When using the old version, you can only get the retrieved answer generated by RAG framework. However, sometimes we also want the original retrieved passages. By using the new version code, you can get both easily. I add detailed examples and comments.

# Study notes
I spent a lot time learning RAG, and added detailed notes in [train_rag.ipynb]. But it's a little bit messy...

# Exa datasets
I tried to use Exa to obtain RAG documents for OpenHermes-2.5 dataset. The code is in [Exa_dataset.ipynb].The result is in [search_response.json]. I gave Exa 100 questions and reached the usage limits. But there were only 10 responses. I haven't figured out why yet.

# Train_critic_model
I fine-tuned ["teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B"] model with self-rag dataset. Detailed things can be found in this folder.\
I used this tutorial provided by Kastan: https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2024-with-trl \
This tutorial is REALLY helpful!!!
