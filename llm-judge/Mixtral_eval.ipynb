       "      <td>Guidance Actions for schools during the coronavirus outbreak\\nPrioritising pupils\\nWhat are our expectations regarding vulnerable children and young people attending educational settings?\\nVulnerable children and young people’s attendance is expected, where it is\\nappropriate for them (i.e. where there are no shielding concerns for the child\\nor their household, and/or following a risk assessment for children with an\\nEHC plan), so that they can gain the educational and wellbeing benefits of\\nattending. Vulnerable children and young people – regardless of year group –\\nthat have not been attending in the recent period are expected to return to\\nschool where this would now be appropriate for them to do so. A brief summary\\nof attendance expectations across the different groups of vulnerable children\\nand young people is as follows:\\n\\nfor vulnerable children and young people who have a social worker, attendance is expected unless the child/household is shielding or clinically vulnerable (see the advice set out by Public Health England on households with possible coronavirus infection, and shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable).\\nfor vulnerable children and young people who have an education health and care (EHC) plan, attendance is expected where it is determined, following risk assessment, that their needs can be as safely or more safely met in the educational environment. Read further guidance on temporary Changes to education, health and care (EHC) needs and assessments\\nfor vulnerable children and young people who are deemed otherwise vulnerable, at the school, college or local authority discretion, attendance is expected unless the child/household is shielding or clinically vulnerable (see the advice set out by Public Health England on households with possible coronavirus infection, and shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable).\\n\\n*[EHC]: Education, Health and Care</td>\n",

       "4            Guidance Actions for schools during the coronavirus outbreak\\nPrioritising pupils\\nWhat are our expectations regarding vulnerable children and young people attending educational settings?\\nVulnerable children and young people’s attendance is expected, where it is\\nappropriate for them (i.e. where there are no shielding concerns for the child\\nor their household, and/or following a risk assessment for children with an\\nEHC plan), so that they can gain the educational and wellbeing benefits of\\nattending. Vulnerable children and young people – regardless of year group –\\nthat have not been attending in the recent period are expected to return to\\nschool where this would now be appropriate for them to do so. A brief summary\\nof attendance expectations across the different groups of vulnerable children\\nand young people is as follows:\\n\\nfor vulnerable children and young people who have a social worker, attendance is expected unless the child/household is shielding or clinically vulnerable (see the advice set out by Public Health England on households with possible coronavirus infection, and shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable).\\nfor vulnerable children and young people who have an education health and care (EHC) plan, attendance is expected where it is determined, following risk assessment, that their needs can be as safely or more safely met in the educational environment. Read further guidance on temporary Changes to education, health and care (EHC) needs and assessments\\nfor vulnerable children and young people who are deemed otherwise vulnerable, at the school, college or local authority discretion, attendance is expected unless the child/household is shielding or clinically vulnerable (see the advice set out by Public Health England on households with possible coronavirus infection, and shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable).\\n\\n*[EHC]: Education, Health and Care   \n",
