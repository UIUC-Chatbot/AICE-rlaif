He gave 4 to Todd. Then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha. So he gave 4 + 4 = 8 gumballs to Alisha. Then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. So he gave 4 * 4 - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 gumballs to Bobby. So he gave 4 + 8 + 11 = 23 gumballs away. He had 6 left. So he started with 6 + 23 = 29 gumballs. The answer is 29.\\n\\n   \n",

It then directly concludes that Erin must be furry, but offers no step in between to arrive at this conclusion. Erin is cold and if someone is furry they are cold, but these statements would have to work in reverse in order to lead to the conclusion that Erin is furry. The correct answer would be \"yes, the hypothesis that Erin is furry is correct based on the following assumptions: Erin is nice. If someone is nice, then they are round. Erin is round.

They gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago.  They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child.  They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child.  How old, in years, is their fourth child?\\n          \\n### Answer: The first child was born 15 years ago. The second child was born 1 year after the first child. The third child was born on the second child's fourth birthday. The fourth child was born 2 years after the third child. So the fourth child is 15 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 22 years old. The answer is 22.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Firstly, The math is off in the previous to last sentence, since the ages of the children should be subtracted, not summed. 15 - 1 - 4 -2 = 8 is the right answer. Secondly, \"So the fourth child is 15 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 22 years old. The answer is 22.\" The fourth born child cannot be older than the first born child.     \n",

There are twice as many red balls as blue while the rest are green. If there are 11 blue balls, how many green balls are there?\\n          \\n### Answer: Ryan has 40 balls. There are twice as many red balls as blue. So there are 20 red balls. The rest are green. 40 - 20 - 11 = 19. The answer is 19.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Saying that there are twice as many red balls as blue doesn't tell us what the total of red balls is, so the deduction that there are 20 is wrongly based. From this wrong premise, the rest of the answer is wrong   \n",

They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?\\n          \\n### Answer: There were 3 adults and children, both girls and boys. Each adult got 3 eggs. So 3 adults got 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. Each boy got 1 more egg than each girl. So 7 girls got 7 eggs. 7 + 7 = 14 eggs. So the boys got 9 + 14 = 23 eggs. 9 + 14 = 23. The answer is 23.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: \"So the boys got 9 + 14 = 23 eggs.\" Where is the 9 coming from? the 14 is girls multiplied by 2 but the 9 has no context.    \n",

He gave 4 to Todd, then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha, and then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha.  If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, what is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased?\\n          \\n### Answer: Hector started with some number of gumballs. He gave 4 to Todd. Then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha. So he gave 4 + 4 = 8 gumballs to Alisha. Then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. So he gave 4 * 4 - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 gumballs to Bobby. So he gave 4 + 8 + 11 = 23 gumballs away. He had 6 left. So he started with 6 + 23 = 29 gumballs. The answer is 29.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Bobby was given 5 gumballs less than four times what was given to Alisha. Alisha got 8 gumballs, so the right calculation would be 8 * 4 - 5, whereas the output says \"4 * 4 - 5\".   \n",

Anne is smart. Charlie is smart. Charlie is young. Dave is young. Harry is quiet. Harry is round. If someone is blue and not smart then they are quiet. If someone is round then they are quiet. Kind people are blue. If someone is young then they are red. If someone is blue then they are round. If Harry is kind and Harry is quiet then Harry is not round. If someone is round and smart then they are kind. If someone is blue then they are kind. All red people are kind.\\n\\nHere is a hypothesis: Charlie is not round.\\n\\nIs the hypothesis correct? Here are three options:\\nNo.\\nYes.\\nUnknown.\\n\\nChoose the correct option and justify your choice:\\n          \\n### Answer: Here is the justification for the answer:\\nIf Charlie is not round, then he must be blue (from the first two lines of the premises). But then he is both blue and smart, which contradicts the third line of the premises. Thus the hypothesis is false.\\n\\n### Feedback: While the answer is correct, the answer misses the steps on how the conclusion was made.   \n",

The cat is kind. The cat visits the mouse. The mouse eats the squirrel. The mouse is cold. The mouse sees the squirrel. The squirrel eats the bald eagle. The squirrel eats the cat. The squirrel eats the mouse. The squirrel is kind. The squirrel visits the cat. If someone visits the mouse and they see the bald eagle then the bald eagle is blue. If someone is blue then they see the cat. If someone eats the bald eagle and the bald eagle sees the cat then the cat is cold. If someone eats the bald eagle then they visit the bald eagle. If someone is kind then they see the bald eagle. Cold people are round. If someone sees the bald eagle and they visit the bald eagle then they visit the cat. If someone is cold and they see the bald eagle then the bald eagle is kind. If someone eats the squirrel and the squirrel eats the mouse then they eat the mouse.\\n\\nHere is a hypothesis: The squirrel sees the cat.\\n\\nIs the hypothesis correct? Here are three options:\\nNo.\\nYes.\\nUnknown.\\n\\nChoose the correct option and justify your choice:\\n          \\n### Answer: Here is a proof by contradiction: Suppose the hypothesis is false, i.e., the squirrel does not see the cat. Then the mouse eats the squirrel (because the squirrel doesn't eat the mouse). But this means the cat sees the bald eagle (since the mouse eating the squirrel causes the mouse to visit the bald eagle, which in turn causes the cat to see the bald eagle). This contradicts our original assumption that the cat does not see the bald eagle. Hence our hypothesis must be true.\\n\\n### Feedback: The answer gives the wrong answer, because it creates a condition between the mouse eating the squirrel and the squirrel eating the mouse that doesn't exist in the context. The correct answer would be that the answer is unknown because there is not enough evidence to provide an answer for this question given the context.   \n",

Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child.  How old, in years, is their fourth child?\\n          \\n### Answer: The first child was born 15 years ago. The second child was born 1 year after the first child. The third child was born on the second child's fourth birthday. The fourth child was born 2 years after the third child. So the fourth child is 15 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 22 years old. The answer is 22.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Firstly, The math is off in the previous to last sentence, since the ages of the children should be subtracted, not summed. 15 - 1 - 4 -2 = 8 is the right answer. Secondly, \"So the fourth child is 15 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 22 years old. The answer is 22.\" The fourth born child cannot be older than the first born child.</td>\n",

He gave 4 to Todd. Then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha. So he gave 4 + 4 = 8 gumballs to Alisha. Then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. So he gave 4 * 4 - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 gumballs to Bobby. So he gave 4 + 8 + 11 = 23 gumballs away. He had 6 left. So he started with 6 + 23 = 29 gumballs. The answer is 29.\\n\\n   \n",

Then the mouse eats the squirrel (because the squirrel doesn't eat the mouse). But this means the cat sees the bald eagle (since the mouse eating the squirrel causes the mouse to visit the bald eagle, which in turn causes the cat to see the bald eagle). This contradicts our original assumption that the cat does not see the bald eagle. Hence our hypothesis must be true.   \n",

It then directly concludes that Erin must be furry, but offers no step in between to arrive at this conclusion. Erin is cold and if someone is furry they are cold, but these statements would have to work in reverse in order to lead to the conclusion that Erin is furry. The correct answer would be \"yes, the hypothesis that Erin is furry is correct based on the following assumptions: Erin is nice. If someone is nice, then they are round. Erin is round.

They gave birth to their first child exactly 15 years ago.  They gave birth to their second child exactly one year after the birth of their first child.  They gave birth to their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child. Two years after the birth of their third child, they gave birth to their fourth child.  How old, in years, is their fourth child?\\n          \\n### Answer: The first child was born 15 years ago. The second child was born 1 year after the first child. The third child was born on the second child's fourth birthday. The fourth child was born 2 years after the third child. So the fourth child is 15 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 22 years old. The answer is 22.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Firstly, The math is off in the previous to last sentence, since the ages of the children should be subtracted, not summed. 15 - 1 - 4 -2 = 8 is the right answer. Secondly, \"So the fourth child is 15 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 22 years old. The answer is 22.\" The fourth born child cannot be older than the first born child.     \n",

There are twice as many red balls as blue while the rest are green. If there are 11 blue balls, how many green balls are there?\\n          \\n### Answer: Ryan has 40 balls. There are twice as many red balls as blue. So there are 20 red balls. The rest are green. 40 - 20 - 11 = 19. The answer is 19.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Saying that there are twice as many red balls as blue doesn't tell us what the total of red balls is, so the deduction that there are 20 is wrongly based. From this wrong premise, the rest of the answer is wrong   \n",

They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?\\n          \\n### Answer: There were 3 adults and children, both girls and boys. Each adult got 3 eggs. So 3 adults got 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. Each boy got 1 more egg than each girl. So 7 girls got 7 eggs. 7 + 7 = 14 eggs. So the boys got 9 + 14 = 23 eggs. 9 + 14 = 23. The answer is 23.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: \"So the boys got 9 + 14 = 23 eggs.\" Where is the 9 coming from? the 14 is girls multiplied by 2 but the 9 has no context.    \n",

He gave 4 to Todd, then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha, and then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha.  If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, what is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased?\\n          \\n### Answer: Hector started with some number of gumballs. He gave 4 to Todd. Then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha. So he gave 4 + 4 = 8 gumballs to Alisha. Then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. So he gave 4 * 4 - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 gumballs to Bobby. So he gave 4 + 8 + 11 = 23 gumballs away. He had 6 left. So he started with 6 + 23 = 29 gumballs. The answer is 29.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feedback: Bobby was given 5 gumballs less than four times what was given to Alisha. Alisha got 8 gumballs, so the right calculation would be 8 * 4 - 5, whereas the output says \"4 * 4 - 5\".   \n",

Anne is smart. Charlie is smart. Charlie is young. Dave is young. Harry is quiet. Harry is round. If someone is blue and not smart then they are quiet. If someone is round then they are quiet. Kind people are blue. If someone is young then they are red. If someone is blue then they are round. If Harry is kind and Harry is quiet then Harry is not round. If someone is round and smart then they are kind. If someone is blue then they are kind. All red people are kind.\\n\\nHere is a hypothesis: Charlie is not round.\\n\\nIs the hypothesis correct? Here are three options:\\nNo.\\nYes.\\nUnknown.\\n\\nChoose the correct option and justify your choice:\\n          \\n### Answer: Here is the justification for the answer:\\nIf Charlie is not round, then he must be blue (from the first two lines of the premises). But then he is both blue and smart, which contradicts the third line of the premises. Thus the hypothesis is false.\\n\\n### Feedback: While the answer is correct, the answer misses the steps on how the conclusion was made.   \n",

The cat is kind. The cat visits the mouse. The mouse eats the squirrel. The mouse is cold. The mouse sees the squirrel. The squirrel eats the bald eagle. The squirrel eats the cat. The squirrel eats the mouse. The squirrel is kind. The squirrel visits the cat. If someone visits the mouse and they see the bald eagle then the bald eagle is blue. If someone is blue then they see the cat. If someone eats the bald eagle and the bald eagle sees the cat then the cat is cold. If someone eats the bald eagle then they visit the bald eagle. If someone is kind then they see the bald eagle. Cold people are round. If someone sees the bald eagle and they visit the bald eagle then they visit the cat. If someone is cold and they see the bald eagle then the bald eagle is kind. If someone eats the squirrel and the squirrel eats the mouse then they eat the mouse.\\n\\nHere is a hypothesis: The squirrel sees the cat.\\n\\nIs the hypothesis correct? Here are three options:\\nNo.\\nYes.\\nUnknown.\\n\\nChoose the correct option and justify your choice:\\n          \\n### Answer: Here is a proof by contradiction: Suppose the hypothesis is false, i.e., the squirrel does not see the cat. Then the mouse eats the squirrel (because the squirrel doesn't eat the mouse). But this means the cat sees the bald eagle (since the mouse eating the squirrel causes the mouse to visit the bald eagle, which in turn causes the cat to see the bald eagle). This contradicts our original assumption that the cat does not see the bald eagle. Hence our hypothesis must be true.\\n\\n### Feedback: The answer gives the wrong answer, because it creates a condition between the mouse eating the squirrel and the squirrel eating the mouse that doesn't exist in the context. The correct answer would be that the answer is unknown because there is not enough evidence to provide an answer for this question given the context.   \n",

It correctly explains how to solve the problem, and it provides the correct answer. The only thing that would make it better is if it provided a little more explanation about why the steps are being taken. For example, it would be helpful to explain why Hector gave twice as many gumballs to Alisha as he did to Todd, and why he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he did to Alisha. This would make the answer more clear and easier to understand for someone who is not already familiar with the problem. However, the answer is still very good and provides a clear explanation of how to solve the problem.   \n",

It correctly calculates the number of people at the gathering. The only thing that could be improved is that the system answer does not explicitly state that the number of people who took both drinks is being counted only once. However, this is implied by the fact that the system answer adds the number of people who took wine, the number of people who took soda, and the number of people who took both drinks.
