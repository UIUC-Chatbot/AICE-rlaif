Taking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope with
stress. Helping others cope with their stress can also make your community
stronger.

Take care of your body. 
Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate.
Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals.
Exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep.
Avoid alcohol and drugs.


Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.
Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling.

Know the facts to help reduce stress
Understanding the risk to yourself and people you care about can make an
outbreak less stressful.

stressed, make a connection with them, and help stop
stigma.

Other financial support
If you’re getting less work or no work because of coronavirus (COVID-19), you
can also:

apply online for Universal Credit
apply for New Style Employment and Support Allowance, if you have a disability or health condition that affects how much you can work

You might also be able to get New Style Employment and Support Allowance if
one for the following applies:

you or your child might have coronavirus or you’re recovering from it
you or your child are self-isolating because you came into contact with someone who might have coronavirus
you have been told to stay at home for at least 12 weeks by the NHS because you’re at high risk of severe illness

You do not need to go into a Jobcentre Plus office to apply or get a payment.
Your Universal Credit payment is based on your actual earnings. You need to
report any self-employed earnings and expenses at the end of each monthly
assessment period.
Processing your application
Because of coronavirus (COVID-19), it might take longer than usual to process

Will I be safe at my reopened school?,"Q&A: Adolescents, youth and COVID-19
Since there are few known cases of adolescents getting seriously ill with COVID-19, should I go to a health facility if I develop symptoms of the disease?
If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is
generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor
your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.  
Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these
facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from
possible COVID-19 and other viruses.  
Seek medical care if your health gets worse, or if there is no one in your
family that can take care of you at home. It is important that you follow the
procedures put in place by your country. Ask a family member or another
trusted adult how you can find out what these procedures are where you live.

"I've been vaccinated against BCG, am I also protected from getting COVID-19?","Q&A on coronaviruses (COVID-19)
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on
the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are
experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have
succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable
so check regularly for the latest news.
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking
some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease. 
Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre. 
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you. 
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. 
Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. 
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.

What can I do to help people that are grieving?,"Coping with Stress

Responding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you, and you may
experience secondary traumatic stress. Secondary traumatic stress is stress
reactions and symptoms resulting from exposure to another individual’s
traumatic experiences, rather than from exposure directly to a traumatic
event.
There are things you can do to reduce secondary traumatic stress reactions:

Acknowledge that secondary traumatic stress can impact anyone helping families after a traumatic event.
Learn the symptoms including physical (fatigue, illness) and mental (fear, withdrawal, guilt).
Allow time for you and your family to recover from responding to the pandemic.
Create a menu of personal self-care activities that you enjoy, such as spending time with friends and family, exercising, or reading a book.
Take a break from media coverage of COVID-19.
Ask for help if you feel overwhelmed or concerned that COVID-19 is affecting your ability to care for your family and patients as you did before the outbreak.

yourself during emergency

What are our expectations regarding vulnerable children and young people attending educational settings?
Vulnerable children and young people’s attendance is expected, where it is
appropriate for them (i.e. where there are no shielding concerns for the child
or their household, and/or following a risk assessment for children with an
EHC plan), so that they can gain the educational and wellbeing benefits of
attending. Vulnerable children and young people – regardless of year group –
that have not been attending in the recent period are expected to return to
school where this would now be appropriate for them to do so. A brief summary
of attendance expectations across the different groups of vulnerable children
and young people is as follows:

for vulnerable children and young people who have a social worker, attendance is expected unless the child/household is shielding or clinically vulnerable (see the advice set out by Public Health England on households with possible coronavirus infection, and shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable).
for vulnerable children and young people who have an education health and care (EHC) plan, attendance is expected where it is determined, following risk assessment, that their needs can be as safely or more safely met in the educational environment. Read further guidance on temporary Changes to education, health and care (EHC) needs and assessments

Employers of rail transit operators should develop a COVID-19 health and
safety plan to protect employees according to CDC business
guidance.
This plan should be shared with you and your coworkers. Your employer should:

Take steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick. Actively encourage sick employees to stay home. Sick employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.
Provide information on who to contact if employees become sick.
Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees.
Designate someone to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact them.
Provide employees with correct information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure.
Provide employees training on proper hand washing practices and other routine infection control precautions. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.
Provide employees access to soap, clean running water, and drying materials or alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at their worksite.
Provide employees with appropriate gloves when necessary and providing training on properly using them.
Provide disposable disinfectant wipes so that surfaces commonly touched by the rail transit operator can be wiped down. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Provide employees training on manufacturer’s directions for use.
Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees.
Place posters that encourage staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing hands often practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.
Reach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.

What do 3rd trimester or at risk healthcare providers take into consideration?,"Coronavirus infection and pregnancy
Occupational health guidance for pregnant women who work in a public-facing role
Q. What is the advice for pregnant healthcare workers after 28 weeks’ gestation, or with an underlying health condition?
If you are in your third trimester (more than 28 weeks’ pregnant), or have an
underlying health condition – such as heart or lung disease – we strongly
recommend you avoid direct patient contact. It is better to work from home
where possible, avoid contact with anyone with symptoms of coronavirus, and
significantly reduce unnecessary social
contact.
Data from the UKOSS study of 427 pregnant women in
May 2020 found the majority of women who have become severely ill were in
their third trimester of pregnancy, emphasising the importance of social
distancing from 28 weeks of pregnancy.
We encourage employers to seek opportunities for pregnant healthcare workers
in their third trimester to work flexibly in a different capacity, to avoid
roles where they are working directly with patients.
Whatever gestation of your pregnancy, you should discuss your individual
circumstances with your local Occupational Health department.
The evidence base for this new virus is growing rapidly and, as and when new
information emerges, the government and professional bodies will update the
guidance.
